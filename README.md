Focused on privacy & internet security I've been online since early 2008 and have seen a lot, loads of change for good making the internet easier to use with more free tools than you could fathom before the internet, but as it's "free" our privacy & data is taken as value. I wish to minimize the impact I have on all these companies & limit the amount of data that anyone can have on me from now on.
